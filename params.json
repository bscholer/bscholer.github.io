I'm very interested in making hardware and software work together, and I find building both of them very fun and interesting, whether it be making an RC Car drive itself, or designing a system allowing you to control your lights from your phone. As Hannah Montana once said, \"You get the best of both worlds.\" If you would like to contact me, all that is below.\r\n\r\n### Contact Me\r\nEmail: <benscholer3248511@gmail.com>\r\nInstagram: Bobby2552\r\n\r\n### Closing\r\nHave a great day!!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
