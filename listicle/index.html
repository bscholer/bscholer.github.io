        for either a very low, or no charge. After reading this article, you will know what they offer, and how
        to get involved with them!</p>

    <p><b>If this an emergency, please call or text 911!</b> If you or someone you know is stuck in a relationship with
        domestic violence involved, the Lafayette YWCA has a
        number of resources to help! From their women’s shelter to counseling and therapy programs, you’ll be able to
        find the right fit, and the right resources to help out yourself or a friend in need.</p>

    <h2 style="display: inline-block;">2) Women's Cancer Programs</h2>

    <p>With cancer as prevalent as it is in today’s day and age, it is ever increasingly important to be checked for
        signs of it regularly. At the YWCA, you can be screened for breast and cervical cancer free of charge, with or
        without insurance! Just call the YWCA at (765) 742-4375 to speak with a specialist to see if you qualify for the
        program.</p>

    <h2 style="display: inline-block">3) Y-Dance Classes</h2>

    <p>Stressed about work or home life? Need a break? Or just need some fun physical activity? The Lafayette YWCA’s
        Y-Dance classes might be perfect for you. For an annual fee of only $25 (an average American coffee drinker
        spends more than $1,500 on coffee a year!), you can have access to a wide range of dance classes, from the
        basics up to more advanced forms of dance. See the <a
