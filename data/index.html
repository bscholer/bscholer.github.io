<p>What's up Trinity! Glad you decided to pop by and visit. Here's an English meme to make it worth your while.</p>

<p>Grammarly and Word both said my grammar is spot-on, so please make this meme a reality, thanks!</p>
<p>PS: The data visualization will not look as trash as this, but I figured I'd throw this together for the hell of it.</p>
<p>Please enjoy this <a href="https://codepen.io/nico3d911/pen/KJXVYz">fun Simon game</a> I found. Didn't have the time or energy to add it to this page, so here we are.</p>
